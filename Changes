    - Changed around the Makefile.PL to assist automation and hopefully
      standardize it a bit for readability.
    - Updated a bunch of dependencies to modern versions and remove those
      which are no longer used.
    - Switched usage of MX:AttributeHelpers to use Native functions that are
      present in modern Mooses.
    - Made it so that parameterized action traits using 'deep' parameters
      (those which are references and not simple scalars) actual work.  Added
      tests for this and a few more test cases for parameterized action traits.

    - Fixed regression introduced in last version related to how
      we expand 'shortname' actionrole namespaces.  We now revert
      to the old behavior until we can reconcile with what is done
      in Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole.
    - Created tests to prevent above regression in the future

    - action classes are now moosified after loading, this means that
      RenderView should now work with isa. (thanks to all reporters!)
    - documented 'isa' action class option (experimental!)
    - fixed bug where setup wasn't called without plugins
    - fixed bug where under block scope wasn't cleaned up
